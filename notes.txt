- faster matmul using BLAS then 4 loops: for m and n <= 10/20 4 loops are faster for 40/50 >= BLAS but check better

- mpicc -I./src -I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include \
    -L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib \
    -o train src/*.c -lopenblas -lm

    mpirun -n 8 ./train 

- this scode in not scalable 
- not a lot of cores means faster traning for example on V=16000 and h=512 is better 4 cores then 8 because with parmters paralell there is a lot of communicaoont among process 
- write amdhal lawa and otehrs stuff and in report copy some parts from paper and link report in github
