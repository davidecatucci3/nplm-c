- faster matmul using BLAS then 4 loops: for m and n <= 10/20 4 loops are faster for 40/50 >= BLAS but check better
- this scode in not scalable 
- not a lot of cores means faster traning for example on V=16000 and h=512 is better 4 cores then 8 because with parmters paralell there is a lot of communicaoont among process 
- write amdhal lawa and otehrs stuff and in report copy some parts from paper and link report in github

TO DO:
- understand if working correctly training (I DONT WANT TO DO FULL TRAIN JUST UNDERSTAND IF ITS A CODE FRO TRAIN)
- doing graph: speedup, scalability and efficeny for diffreent problem size and for process: 1 2 4 8 (doing 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 on aws ...)

- HOW MUCH OF THIS CODE IS PARALLELIZABLE?:
- get chunk: x
- first layer: x
- second layer: y
- softmax/normalize: y
- clear grad: x
- backward i-th block: y
- hidden layer w: x
- feature vectors: x

9 block of code -> 3 parallelizlbe so 9 / 3 = 3 -> 33.3% of code is parallelizible
